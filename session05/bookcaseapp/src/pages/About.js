        <h2>Why reading is so important</h2>
        <p className="about-text">
        Reading helps to expand the mind and give us more ideas. Reading has been proven to keep our minds young, healthy and sharp. <br></br>
        Reading is also a way to escape your own life, and can take you to faraway lands, other times, and put you in other peopleâ€™s shoes. By viewing the world from a point of view that is not your own, you become more empathetic.
